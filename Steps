First, import the necessary modules such as pyautogui, keyboard, and time. These modules will be used for creating the hotkeys and controlling the mouse movement.

Create a function for target tracking that takes in parameters such as fov, speed, projectile prediction and humanizer scale. These parameters will be used to determine the behavior of the target tracker.

Use the pyautogui module to track the mouse movement and position, and use the keyboard module to create hotkeys for activating and deactivating the target tracker.

Create an algorithm that uses the fov and speed, and projectile prediction parameters to determine the movement of the mouse. Use the humanizer scale to add randomness to the mouse movement, making it appear more human-like.

Create alternate clickbot and flickbot modes by modifying the algorithm and adding new hotkeys for activating and deactivating them.

Use the most efficient and optimized algorithm and modules to ensure that the target tracker runs smoothly and doesn't cause any lag.

Ensure each mode will only run when the hotkey to start the program is held down and stops when it is released. This key is seperate from the keys to select the mode.

Create a GUI using a module such as tkinter to allow users to easily customize the target tracker settings and activate different modes.
